# Cardkiller The Game

In this game you have 3 types of cards:<br>
Potions (Will heal your health with the ammount that's on the card with a max of your max health).<br>
Monsters (Will depleat your health with the ammount that's on the card).<br>
Coins (Will give you coins, theres are meant as a scoring system and are used to draw cards from the deck).<br>

In this game you can play 2 gamemodes: a normal mode with a set ammount of cards or infinite mode.<br>
In the normal mode the goal is to play out all the cards without dying and get a nice ammount of coins on the side as score.<br>
In the infinite mode the goal is to get as much coins as possible and play as many cards as possible before you die.<br>

After that small instruction to the game all i have left to say is,<br>
Good luck!
