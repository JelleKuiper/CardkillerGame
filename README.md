# CardkillerGame
All files to my cardkiller game!

In this game you have 3 types of cards:
Potions (Will heal your health with the ammount that's on the card with a max of your max health).
Monsters (Will depleat your health with the ammount that's on the card).
Coins (Will give you coins, theres are meant as a scoring system and are used to draw cards from the deck).

In this game you can play 2 gamemodes: a normal mode with a set ammount of cards or infinite mode.
In the normal mode the goal is to play out all the cards without dying and get a nice ammount of coins on the side as score.
In the infinite mode the goal is to get as much coins as possible and play as many cards as possible before you die.

After that small instruction to the game all i have left to say is,
Good luck!
